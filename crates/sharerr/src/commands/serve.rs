//! `sharerr serve` — the long-running mode: periodic reconciliation plus HTTP.
//!
//! One router carries everything: `/health` and `/ready` for the orchestrator, the
//! web UI ([`crate::web`]), sharerr's own tracker ([`crate::tracker`]), and the
//! Torznab feed a friend's Prowlarr indexes ([`crate::torznab`]). One process, one
//! port — whatever makes 8477 reachable makes all of it reachable.
//!
//! Serving is deliberately decoupled from being *configured*. An instance whose
//! vault has no `qbittorrent.password` in it yet still binds, still answers
//! `/health`, and reports the reason on `/ready`. The fix for that state is the
//! web UI (or `sharerr vault set` inside the running container), and a process
//! that exits during startup can never be reached by either — it just
//! restart-loops, and the operator has nowhere to type the password.
//!
//! The state all of this shares lives in [`crate::state`], not here: the tracker,
//! the feed, and the web UI need it too, and they are general layers rather than
//! CLI verbs.
