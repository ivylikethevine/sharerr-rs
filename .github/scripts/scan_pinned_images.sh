# The severity half of digest-pinning, and the gate dependabot cannot offer.
#
# Every Dockerfile and compose file in this repo pins its base image by digest,
# and dependabot opens the repin PR on release. Neither of those knows whether
# the bump *fixes* anything: dependabot's docker ecosystem has no
# security-update mode at all (GHSA has no container ecosystem, so there are no
# alerts to drive one), and a digest is just a digest. This script supplies the
# missing question — would repinning reduce the number of fixable
# CRITICAL/HIGH findings? — and answers it by measuring both sides rather than
# assuming.
#
# Per pinned image:
#
#   1. scan the pinned digest              -> A, the fixable CVE ids today
#   2. A empty                             -> clean, say nothing
#   3. scan the tag                        -> B, and the digest it resolves to
#   4. that digest == the pinned one       -> upstream has not rebuilt yet
#   5. |B| >= |A|                          -> rebuilt, but the hole survives
#   6. |B| < |A|                           -> ACTIONABLE: the repin closes A-B
#
# Only 6 is worth waking anyone for, which is the point: the job speaks when a
# bump is known to help, and stays quiet when it is churn. A seventh outcome
# sits before 2 — trivy identifying an OS it has no data for — and is kept
# distinct from "clean" for the reason the code that detects it gives.
#
# --ignore-unfixed is load-bearing, not a flag. debian:bookworm-slim alone
# reports a double-digit pile of permanent won't-fix findings; a job that counts
# those is red forever and teaches everyone to skip it. It is also what makes
# the comparison above mean anything: two piles of permanent won't-fix findings
# differ by noise rather than by severity.
#
# This is separate from the `trivy` job in image-scan.yml, which scans the
# image *this repo publishes* rather than the images it builds on. That one asks
# "has what we shipped gone stale"; this one asks "is there a better base to
# build the next one from".
#
# Writes a markdown report (the workflow uses it for both the step summary and
# the issue body) and exits:
#
#   0  clean - nothing pinned has a fixable CRITICAL/HIGH finding
#   1  a finding exists, but no repin would improve on it
#   2  at least one repin is verified to reduce the count
#
